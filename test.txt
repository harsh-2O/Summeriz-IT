Switching Java (JDK) Versions on MacOS | by Dev Sharma | Medium Get unlimited access Open in app Home Notifications Lists Stories Write Dev Sharma Follow Mar 26, 2019 ¬∑ 2 min read Switching Java (JDK) Versions on MacOS This tutorial will guide you on how to switch JAVA versions on your MacOS device. This can be useful for working with apps which don‚Äôt work with updated JAVA versions. For example, applications such as Cassandra will only work with JAVA version 8. First, you need to make certain you have multiple JAVA versions installed. Open a new  Terminal  window and input: /usr/libexec/java_home -V Your output should look like: Matching Java Virtual Machines (2): 11.0.1, x86_64: "Java SE 11.0.1" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home 1.8.0_201, x86_64: "Java SE 8" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_201.jdk/Contents/Home Note that there are two JDKs available. If you don‚Äôt notice the Java version you need to switch to, download and install the appropriate one from  here  (JDK 8 is represented as 1.8) . Once you have installed the appropriate JDK, repeat this step. 2. Take note of the JDK version you want to switch to. For example, ‚Äú11.0‚Äù and ‚Äú1.8‚Äù are the JDK versions available in the example above. 3. Switch to the desired version. For example, if you wish to switch to JDK 8, input the following line: export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8` For 11.0, switch ‚Äú1.8‚Äù with ‚Äú11.0‚Äù 4. Check your JDK version by inputting into  Terminal : java -version If you have followed all the steps correctly, the JDK version should correlate with the one you specified in the last step. 5. (Optional) To make this the default JDK version, input the following in  Terminal : open ~/.bash_profile Then, add your Terminal input from step 3 to this file: # SWITCH TO JAVA VERSION 8 export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8` Save and close the file. Done. -- -- 8 More from Dev Sharma Follow MSc Analytics @ Columbia Love podcasts or audiobooks?
